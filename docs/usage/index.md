# Usage

DigitalPersona Device Access (DP DA) is a Windows service and a user agent application running 
locally on a user device and providing access to authentication devices like fingerprint readers,
smarrtcard readers etc. These devices are not directly accessible from Javascript running in a browser.
The `device-access.js` library communicates with the DP DA agent via a secure message channel,
allowing to implement composite authentication in web pages.
