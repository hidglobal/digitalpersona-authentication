# Documenting Guidelines

All development documentation must be a part of the project source base so that they:
- are immediately accessible to developers cloning the repository, i.e. not requiring external document hosting on platforms such as Confluence.
- have full history tracking
- can easily be referred to and linked from other web pages via the TFS web interface.

The preferrable format for the documentation is Markdown.
- It is an enriched text format, so developers can easily see diffs in Git.
- It remains readable in any text viewer, even those lacking specific Markdown support.
- It integrates well with the TFS web interface. The `Readme.md` file is a default documentation enry point in TFS repositories and automatically displays when TFS  repos are opened in a web browser.
