# Documenting Guidelines

All development documentation must be a part of the project source base,
so they are
- immediately accessible to developers cloning the repository
  (no need in external document hosting like Confluence)
- has a full history tracking
- documents still can be referred and linked from other web pages
  via TFS web interface

Documents preferrable format is Markdown:
- it is an enriched text format, so developers can easily see diffs in Git
- it remains readable in any text viewer, even lacking Markdown support.
- it integrates well with the TFS web interface. The `Readme.md` file is a
  default documentation enry point in TFS repositories and automaticaly
  shows up when open TFS web repos in a browser.
